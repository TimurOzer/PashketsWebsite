                <h3>Introduction and Concept</h3>
                <p>The name 'Pasha' in Pasha Token is inspired by my cat.</p>
                <p>The purpose of Pasha Token is to turn our love for cats into a culture. Each of our cats is our own 'Pasha'.</p>
                <p>Pasha Token aims to create and develop a new 'Pasha' culture together with the community. Our goal is to strive to be as much 'Pashket' as possible. (Pashket means having a respectable role in our community and is a title that can only be used by those who own a specific number of tokens. They are the pioneers of the community.)</p>
                
                <h3>Market Analysis</h3>
                <p>According to CoinGecko data, the market value of Solana memecoins is currently $9.79 billion. Overall, Solana memecoins have a market value of over $1 million. The most valuable one, WIF, has a value of $2 billion. Since our token supply is 1 billion, our goal is to reach a market value of $1 billion. This would mean 1 Pasha Token = $1.</p>
                
                <h3>Token Economy-1</h3>
                <p>Token Volume: 1,000,000,000 (One Billion) Pasha Tokens<br>
                Token Address: Begins with PASHA*********<br>
                Token Distribution:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>40% Public Trading (400,000,000 Pasha Tokens)</li>
                    <li>15% Reward Pool (150,000,000 Pasha Tokens)</li>
                    <li>30% Development Team (300,000,000 Pasha Tokens)</li>
                    <li>15% Pre-Order for early investors (150,000,000 Pasha Tokens)</li>
                </ul>
                <p>There will be no burning or minting of Pasha Tokens. 150,000,000 Pasha Tokens will be awarded to the top 5 people with the most likes on Twitter and Reddit platforms weekly (total of 10 people), with 100,000 Pasha Tokens given to each. This event will continue for 50 weeks.</p>
                <p>The remaining 100 million Pasha Token reward pool will be:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>25 million will be distributed as 250,000 Pasha Tokens to winners of weekly Pashket art contests. This contest will run for 100 weeks.</li>
                    <li>75 million will be reserved for new contests and projects next year.</li>
                </ul>
                <p>Note: You can only benefit from these rewards once. We should also give opportunities to our other friends.</p>
                
                <h3>Token Economy-2</h3>
                <p>Pasha Token Pre-Order aims for 1,500,000 out of 150,000,000 Pasha Tokens to be worth $100 in Solana. If the Pre-Order sales are successfully completed, we will be able to create a liquidity pool worth $10,000 in Solana. 100,000,000 Pasha Tokens will be used for the first public trading pool. According to the Raydium bot, since this liquidity pool will subsequently mean that Pasha’s initial launch value is 100,000,000 Pasha Tokens = $10,000, the starting value of Pasha Token will be $0.0001. The first buyers from the Pre-Order will directly own an asset worth $150.</p>
                <p>When the Pasha Token pre-order is completed, 10% will be publicly listed on the Raydium market. All Solana from the Pre-Order will be used for the liquidity pool.</p>
                
                <h3>Pasha Token Pool</h3>
                <p>This year, only 100,000,000 Pasha Tokens will be allocated for the liquidity pool. When we enter 2026, another 100,000,000 will be added to the pool. Similarly, 100,000,000 will be added in 2027, and finally, another 100,000,000 Pasha Tokens will be added in 2028 to increase liquidity.</p>
                <h3>Technological Infrastructure</h3>
                <p>Pasha Token, a memecoin project created on the Solana network, is shaped according to the amount of Pasha Tokens you hold. If you hold 5% or more of the Pasha Token supply, you become a "Pashket".</p>
                <p>Special events will be held every 6 months for Pashkets.</p>
                
                <h3>Community and Marketing Strategy</h3>
                <p>An effective marketing strategy will be developed to create and grow the Pasha Token community. We will inform our community through social media, forums, and events.</p>
                
                <h3>Development Timeline (RoadMap)</h3>
                <ul>
                    <li>Phase 1: Initial sales and promotion process of Pasha Token (2024 - Q1)</li>

                </ul>
                
                <h3>Competitor Analysis</h3>
                <p>Compared to similar memecoin projects, Pasha Token offers an innovative approach. We aim to differentiate by prioritizing community participation.</p>
                
                <h3>Risks and Challenges</h3>
                <p>The success of the Pasha Token project depends on market conditions and community support. However, we have a strong team and strategy to overcome these challenges.</p>
                
                <h3>Conclusion and Call to Action</h3>
                <p>We are bringing together our love and passion for cats with Pasha Token. We invite everyone to join Pasha Token and be a part of our community.</p>
