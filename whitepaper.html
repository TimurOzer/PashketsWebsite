            <h2>Introduction and Concept</h2>
            <p>• The name 'Pasha' in Pasha Token's name is inspired by my cat.<br>
            • Pasha Token's goal is to turn our cats into a culture we love. Each of our cats is our own 'Pasha'.<br>
            • Pasha Token aims to create and develop a new 'Pasha' culture together with the community.<br>
            • Our goal is to try to be as 'Pashket' as possible. (Pashket means a respected role in our community and is a title only available to those who hold a certain number of tokens. They are the pioneers of the community).</p>

            <h2>Market Analysis</h2>
            <p>• Solana memecoins have a market capitalization of $9.79 billion as of today, according to CoinGecko.<br>
            • Overall, Solana memecoins have a market capitalization of over $1 million. The most valuable, WIF, has a market capitalization of $2 billion. Since our token supply is 1 billion, our goal is to increase the market capitalization to 1 billion dollars. In this way, 1 Pasha Token = $1.</p>

            <h2>Token Economy-1</h2>
            <p>• TokenVolume: 1.000.000.000.000 (One Billion) Pasha Token<br>
            Token Address: PASHA********* will start with<br>
            Token Distribution:<br>
            • 40% Public trading (400,000,000 Pasha Token)<br>
            • 15% Reward Pool (150,000,000 Pasha Token)<br>
            • 30% Development Team (300.000.000 Pasha Token)<br>
            • 15% for Pre-Order investors (150.000.000 Pasha Token)<br>
            • There will be no burning or minting of Pasha Token.<br>
            • 150,000,000 Pasha Tokens will be awarded as 100,000 Pasha Tokens per person to the 5 people (10 people in total on Twitter + Reddit) with the most weekly likes on Twitter and Reddit platforms. This event will run for 50 weeks.<br>
            • Of the remaining 100 million Pasha Token prize pool:<br>
            • 25 million will be distributed as 250,000 Pasha Tokens to the winners of the weekly Pashket image contests. This contest will run for 100 weeks.<br>
            • 75 million will be reserved for new contests and projects next year.<br>
            • Note: You can only benefit from these rewards once. We should give the opportunity to our other friends.</p>

            <h2>Token Economy-2</h2>
            <p>• Pasha Token Pre-Order<br>
            • For 1,500,000 of the 150,000,000 Pasha Tokens, we are targeting $100 worth of Solana. If Pre-Order sales are successful, we will be able to create a $10,000 Solana liquidity pool. For the first public trading pool, 100,000,000 Pasha tokens will be used. According to the Raydium bot, the initial value of Pasha after this liquidity pool will be $0.0001, as the initial exit value of Pasha will be 100,000,000 Pasha Tokens = $10,000. The first people to Pre-Order will directly receive an asset worth $150.<br>
            • Once the Pasha Token pre-order is complete, 10% of it will be publicly listed on the Raydium market. All Solana from the Pre-Order will be used for the liquidity pool.<br>
            • Pasha Token Pool<br>
            • This year only 100,000,000 Pasha Tokens will be allocated to the liquidity pool. As we enter 2026, another 100,000,000 will be added to the pool. Likewise, another 100,000,000 Pasha Tokens will be added in 2027 and a final 100,000,000 in 2028 to increase liquidity.</p>

            <h2>Technological Infrastructure</h2>
            <p>• Pasha Token, a memecoin project created on the Solana network, is governed by the amount of Pasha Token you hold. If you own 5% or more of the Pasha Token supply, you become a “Pashket”.<br>
            • Pashkets have access to a private channel in our Discord group. This channel usually provides the right to organize events related to the Pasha Token, offer suggestions on the future of the token and participate in voting.<br>
            • The status of Pashkets may change; this is a normal process. If a Pashket sells its Pasha Tokens and drops below 5%, this role will be taken away from it.</p>

            <h2>Community and Marketing Strategy</h2>
            <p>• In our community building strategy, general community building will be done through Discord and Reddit. Twitter and Instagram will be used mostly for advertising and announcements. Telegram will only be used for announcements.<br>
            • You will be able to access all the events we will organize on our social media platforms.<br>
            • To communicate with the development team, you can open a ticket on our Discord server and submit your questions or suggestions.<br>
            • 150,000,000 Pasha Tokens will be distributed as 100,000 Pasha Tokens per person to the 5 people with the most likes on Twitter and Reddit platforms (10 people in total on Twitter + Reddit). This event will continue for 50 weeks. Of the remaining 100 million Pasha Token prize pool, 25 million will be awarded as 250,000 Pasha Tokens to the winners of the weekly Pashaket image contests. This competition will run for 100 weeks.</p>

            <h2>Development Calendar</h2>
            <p>• 2024-2025 Pasha Token's Pre-Order and events (If Pre-Order ends early, the 2025-2026 plan will be moved earlier)<br>
            • 2025-2026 Pasha Token's liquidity pool creation, listing on crypto exchanges and events<br>
            • 2026-2027 Pasha Token's liquidity pool expansion and events<br>
            • 2027-2028 Pasha Token's recent liquidity pool expansion and events<br>
            • 2028 and later Pasha Token's events</p>

            <h2>Competitor Analysis</h2>
            <p>• Other Solana memecoins, our competitors, are often based on an existing meme culture or, like us, are trying to build their own meme cultures. Solana memecoins are growing rapidly in terms of market and ecosystem. Most of the trending memecoins originate from the Solana ecosystem.<br>
            • However, the number of successful Solana memecoins is small. This is mainly due to the fact that memecoins have limited use cases or are only marketed through videos or images. We plan to solve this problem with a "Gamify” approach. The responsibility for developing the meme culture in Pasha Token does not only belong to the development team; our goal is to build a new culture by rewarding everyone who contributes to the development of this culture with Pasha Token.</p>

            <h2>Risks and Challenges</h2>
            <p>• The biggest challenge we will face is gaining people's trust. Investors may be skeptical of new memecoins due to the large number of pump-dumps in the market. To minimize this concern, the development team plans to hold our tokens until they are listed on a major crypto exchange. We also aim to minimize the risk of investors dumping by creating a liquidity pool with limited supply.<br>
            • With the Pashket system, we are trying to enable both the development team and investors to hold their tokens. What happens if someone from the development team loses their Pashket role? We continue to work together in the development process, but he/she cannot participate in voting processes. Our goal is to make it sustainable by creating a loyal community.</p>

            <h2>Conclusion and Call</h2>
            <p>• Thank you for reading this far. Whether you are a new crypto investor or an experienced investor, we are here to help you with any questions or concerns. The Pasha Token community is committed to supporting you every step of the way.<br>
            • If you're ready to be a part of this unique community and culture, we invite you to join us as a future Pashket. Let’s develop and enrich the Pasha culture together! Come join us in this journey and be a part of the future with Pasha Token.</p>
