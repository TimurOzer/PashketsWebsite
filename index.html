                <li>The name 'Pasha' in Pasha Token is inspired by my cat.</li>
                <li>The aim of Pasha Token is to transform our love for cats into a culture. Each of our cats is our own 'Pasha'.</li>
                <li>Pasha Token aims to create and develop a new 'Pasha' culture together with the community.</li>
                <li>Our goal is to try to be as many 'Pashkets' as possible. (A Pashket means a respected role within our community and is a title that can only be used by those who hold a certain amount of tokens. They are the pioneers of the community.)</li>

                    <p>We aim to raise $100 worth of Solana for 1,500,000 out of 150,000,000 Pasha Tokens. If pre-order sales are successfully completed, we will be able to create a liquidity pool worth $10,000. 100,000,000 Pasha Tokens will be used for the first public trading pool.</p>
                    <p>According to the Raydium bot, since the initial value of Pasha will be 100,000,000 Pasha Tokens = $10,000, the starting value of Pasha Token will be $0.0001. The first purchasers from the pre-order will directly own an asset worth $150.</p>

                    <p>This year, only 100,000,000 Pasha Tokens will be allocated for the liquidity pool. As we enter 2026, another 100,000,000 will be added to the pool. Similarly, 100,000,000 will be added in 2027, and finally, another 100,000,000 Pasha Tokens will be added in 2028 to increase liquidity.</p>
